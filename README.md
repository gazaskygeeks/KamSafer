# User Guide

## Development Setup

### tech

- node 8 & npm>5
- postgres

### Steps

1. run `git clone` of this repo and `cd` into the folder
1. Provision a postgres database (either locally or remotely)
1. In the root directory create a `.env` file
   1. Add the database url as an environment variable, `DB_URL`
   1. A jwt secret variable, named `SECRET`
   1. User log in variables, `DB_USERNAME` and `DB_HASHED`. To generate the hash run `node lib/hasher [plaintext password]` and copy the printed value.
1. commands (from root):
   - `npm i` install server dependencies
   - `npm start` run production server
   - `npm run dev` run dev server using nodemon
   - `cd client && npm i` install react app dependencies
   - `cd client && npm start` run dev-server react app
   - `cd client && npm build` build react app
1. The server will run on `PORT=4000` while the dev react app will run at `PORT=3000`
1. To initialise some cars in your database you need to run the `db_build.js` file in `src/database/config/`
   1. Edit the file to change the `carsArray` data if you want to.
   1. When you are happy with it, run the file using `node [path to file]` **NOTE** This will **wipe the database completely**. Do not attempt to run to edit anything in a production base. The file _should_ abort if `DB_HOST` is not `localhost` anyway but you should not even think about running this file if you have production database credentials in your `.env`.
